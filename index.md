Bioinformatics: Advanced Single Cell RNA-Seq Workshop  
May 26, 2020, 9 a.m. - May 28, 2020, 4:30 p.m. online learning
Aug. 17, 2020, 9 a.m. - Aug. 19, 2020, 4:30 p.m. @ UC Davis 
Organizer - Bioinformatics Core  
Contact - UC Davis Bioinformatics Core, training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu

This workshop will cover advanced topics in experimental design, data generation, and analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data (primarily generated using the 10x platform) on the command line and within the R statistical programming language. Participants will explore software and protocols, create and modify workflows, and diagnose/treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services. Exercises will be performed on the command line and within R with a provided dataset. The primary packages used for analysis will be 10x software (for sequence reads to counts) and the R packages (ex. Seurat) for downstream analysis.

Participants should be familiar with the material covered in the Introduction to Single Cell RNA-Seq Workshop, including the use of the command line and R. Prior experience with the command line and R is a must to fully participate If you would like to attend, listen and learn, that is OK, but we will be undable to train you in how to use the command line and R during this workshop. This workshop will be held in Davis and will run from 9:00am to 5:00pm each day and include light breakfast, lunch, and snacks.

Participants must bring their own laptops to use, which should have a recent version of R, Rstudio, and Java installed, and an application that allows them to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple), as well as the ability to connect to the internet via wifi.

### FAQ

Who should attend? … Prior course participants have included faculty, post docs, grad students, staff, and industry researchers.

What are the prerequisites? … Participants should be familiar with the material covered in the Introduction to Single Cell RNA-Seq Workshop, including the use of the command line and R. Prior experience with the command line and R is a must to fully participate. If you would like to attend, listen and learn, that is OK, but we will be undable to train you in how to use the command line and R during this workshop.

What do I need to bring? … You will need to bring your own laptop to use, have a recent version of R, Rstudio, and Java installed, and an application that will allow you to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple) as well as the ability to connect to the internet via wifi. Computational exercises will be performed on a remote server. We can help with setup early on in the workshop. If your department does not allow you to install software on the laptop you’ll be bringing, please contact us ahead of time.

Can I bring my own data? … We will provide experimental datasets for use during the workshop, as this helps to keep the workshop moving. There will be time, however, to discuss your own datasets and how you might work with them outside of the workshop.

How much does it cost? … The registration fee is $1500 for UC and UC affiliates, $1750 for other academic or non-profit participants and $2,500 for other participants. Late registrations (within one month of workshop start date) are subject to a 20% price increase. We accept credit cards, as well as UC Davis recharge accounts, for payment.  Registration fees include light breakfast, lunch, and snacks, but do not include dinner, lodging or parking fees.

Where is the workshop? … It will be held in the Multi-Purpose Room at the UC Davis Student Community Center and will run from 9:00am to 5:00pm on the dates indicated.

How do I apply? … All registration is “first-come, first-served.” There is no application process. Sign up as soon as possible to ensure your place in the workshop.
